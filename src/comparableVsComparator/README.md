# Comparisons Demo, points to remember

refer 

remember you can only use comparable's compare method thus, once u make sort criteria selection, you lose your chance of sorting them any other way; however, your clients who use your objects can define their own sorting criteria by passing classes which imples comparator which declare's compareTo(obj1, obj2) 

If you want to sort based on many dynamic criteria, comparators always come handy.
