lambda expressions are also called anonymous functions
 
why we need to use lambda expressions compared to imperative style? 


```java
// from java 8, developers thought of introducing functional style prog. 
		Game footBallLambda = () -> System.out.println("I am playing foot ball");
		Series odiSeries = (type) -> System.out.println(" The series is of type" + type); 

```

### advantages of lambdas
1. more readable
2. less lines of code


### advantages of maps
1. maps are useful in converting object of 1 type to another 


## More on flatMaps
If an object has another object in it, then use flatmap.
It takes stream as input and outputs stream
